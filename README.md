# This is a programme picking a student whoose turn to answer or work.
## It was created in order to work in ESL teaching with students.
## The programme based on the modules "random" and "tkinter" in a random way chooses a name of the student. It engages and encourages students to be always ready to answer as no one knows whoose turn will be next.
#### When my students saw this programme first time, they were really excited and fascinated.
